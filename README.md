#  Assessing Crowd Engagement using Artificial Intelligence-based Audio Signal Processing
This a dissertation project aims to utilize machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, 
combined with audio signal processing techniques, to estimate proxy crowd engagement 
based on annotated audio features, such as density, music, conversation, speech, and crowd noise. 
Crowd engagement was assessed by analyzing and extracting features from audio recordings collected during the BD25 events.
